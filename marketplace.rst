triggerFS gives you the platform for high-speed realtime messaging. But that is only a small fraction of what this is all about, really. What really powers triggerFS is the gigantic amount of plugins you can use to do any kind of task. These plugins or the combination of several of them is what makes triggerFS a pleasure to work with.

Those plugins need a place where they can be listed to the public, so everyone can benefit and download and use them. That is our vision of building the triggerFS marketplace. Anyone who can write go (https://golang.org/) can also write plugins. Check out our core plugins so you can get a feeling of how a plugin works. Our plugin skeleton has 57 lines of code (loc). Add your own function to it and you have just created your first own plugin.

Plugins are small pieces of code, doing one thing and doing it well. We want to build as many plugins as possible for any kind of job. You can host them on github and link your repository in the triggerFS marketplace, making it accessible within the triggerFS app. Our goal is to provide you with tons of plugins with the help of the community in the near future.

This should give a simple overview of what triggerFS is. But there is so much more to it. Please refer to our official documentations at https://triggerfs.io if you want to know how much fun you can have with triggerFS.
