Use Cases & Examples
====================

TriggerFS is here to help you with the right tool. We don't want to invent anything new, we want to take already existing parts and put them together to build a system which can deliver the experience many people are looking for when:

- there is a new problem to be solved
- building distributed systems can actually be tricky
- suddenly automating things becomes relevant
- communication across boundaries is necessary but firewalls are in your way
- tasks need to be outsourced to other systems
- tasks need to be scheduled
- periodic tasks need to be run
- geo-replication is a topic
- a "serverless" design is taken into consideration
- lambda functions on own servers are needed
- fire&forget-style events could be needed
- wanting a central place where everything can be run (triggered) from
